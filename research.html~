  <h3>Modeling Complex Economic Systems Using Fitness Landscapes: Theory, Data and Simulations.</h3>
   <img src="FitnessLand.png">
  <p>Developed initially in evolutionary biology, the concept of fitness landscape has found numerous applications in studying economic systems. The idea was initially conceived by the seminal work of Sewall Wright and popularized successively thanks to the work of Stuart Kauffman. Fitness landscapes offered a framework to understand how the emergence, development and evolution of solutions to a complex economic phenomena can be perceived as an adaptive search, carried out by an agent or a collection of agents, for an optimal solution in a given space of solutions. The purpose of this project will be to explore the application of the concept of fitness landscapes to studying complex economic phenomena and provide guidance for future research.The project is structured in three main parts.<br><br>  
In the first part, I will review the literature on the structure and dynamics of fitness landscapes. The different definitions and theories of fitness landscapes will be defined, illustrating the difference between random and deterministic landscapes. Successively, an illustration is provided regarding the main metrics used in fitness analysis, like adaptive walk, random walk, long jumps, correlation length, local and global optima, ruggedness, walk entropy, basins of attraction and other. I will also investigate the internal and external factors that might change the structure of fitness landscapes (for example the expansion of the landscape or changing fitness values).
<br><br> In the second part, the current project investigates existing and possible applications of the concept of fitness landscapes in economic modeling, and in particular in the fields of technological innovation, management and finance. Related concepts like production recipe, recombination, product space, technological graphs, radical vs. incremental innovations, exploration vs. exploitation, observational learning, evolutionary agent-based models and other are presented with particular focus on their meaning in economics. Finally, some perspectives are discussed regarding the extent to which realistic fitness landscapes can be modeled in economics using available data. 
<br><br> In the last part, the project discusses some of the algorithmic issues related to the simulation of fitness landscapes. Concepts like covariance matrices, random fields, Cholesky decomposition, Perlin noise , circulant embedding are discussed in relation to the simulation of random landscapes. The paper will show some of the different visualization tools used to plot fitness landscapes in different dimensions.

  <h3>Growth Dynamics in Temporal Networks</h3>
    <img src="growth.png">
        <p style="font-size:1vw ;line-height: 0.1vw"><i>In collaboration with Reza Jafari and Rosario Mantegna</i><p>    
  <p>Analyzing complex systems using network theory is a main trend in mathematical physics. In many cases, activities like communicating on social networks, trading in
markets and search into the internet are events that happen in specific temporal framework. To understand the temporal dimension of complex networks, the concept of temporal networks has been introduced. Recent literature on temporal networks has explained different temporal features of real networks like, for example, different types of temporal networks, measures of temporal topological structure , spreading dynamics, and compartmental models. <br><br>
We believe that one of the most interesting problems in temporal networks is the modeling of the complex behavior observed for vertices, i.e. the drivers behind each nodes’ decision to set up certain links with certain other nodes and the magnitude of the links that are set up. For example, in marketing recommender systems, nodes (consumers) are expected to establish temporal links with products based on preferences, item's general acceptance, and inuence from social friends . In finnancial markets, agents may establish links through time with others based on trust.
In this paper, we propose a model to explain the temporal dynamics of link (event) formation in temporal networks. <br><br>
We present our model as a network model with a preferential connection component, where a node is chosen at random to participate in an event with a preferential tendency to connect with the most active nodes. Active nodes are nodes whose cumulative degree is high, where cumulative degree is the sum of all historical events in which a node participated. In the second section, in addition to the preferential component which is a global property, we add a memory as a second component in
the node's decision to establish a link. Memory is included to reflect the localization effect in the decision of nodes to participate in temporal events. Numerical results are presented and discussed for both models. In the second version of our model, memory is introduced into the system by using the theory of <i>fractional calculus</i>. Fractional Calculus allows us to express an ordinary differential equation with memory using a fractional-order equation that does not include explicitly the concept of memory. Several studies, in an attempt to describe the effect of past on the present events, have employed fractional integrals and derivatives as a generalization of ordinary differential integral operators to non-integer ones.

  <h3>A General Theory of Financial Innovation Processes</h3>
      <img src="fininnovation.jpg">
         <p style="font-size:1vw ;line-height: 0.1vw"><i>In collaboration with Keren Arthur - Under revision by Financial Innovation (Springer)</i><p>  
  <p>Increasing attention has been paid to the topic of financial innovation since the last financial crisis of 2008. Despite the wide acceptance in literature of the benefits of financial innovations to the real economy (e.g. Shiller, 2012, 2013; Van Horne, 1985, 1986, 1992; Finnerty, 1992; Merton, 1992; Levine, 2005), the crisis of 2008 has made financial innovation a focus in a time of re-evaluation and re-conceptualization (Engelenetal., 2010, Greenwood and Scharfstein, 2013). Some researchers have claimed that misuse or abuse of financial innovations have been one of the factors leading to the 2008 financial crisis (Bozand Mendoza, 2014; Hausmanand Johnston, 2014). Others started to examine what became called the “Dark Side” of financial innovations (Allen, 2012, Diaz-Rainey and Ibikunle, 2012; Henderson and Pearson, 2011). Allen (2012) finds empirical evidence suggesting that financial innovation increases the complexity of transactions, resulting in opportunities to explore questions of interest to the consumers of financial services. For this reason, a wave of pessimism has been raising concerning the long term effect of the increasing complexity of financial innovations. Regulation has been increasing in complexity (Acharya etal. 2010), calls for responsible financial innovation and good governance has also been notably increasing (Armstrong and Muniesa, 2012; Asante et al. 2014). On the other hand, the market competition for financial innovation is undergoing several changes thanks to the Fintech startups who are introducing financial innovations that in many cases promise to deliver better and safer services than traditional financial institutions.<br><br>
All of these factors and others create new challenges for the management and regulation of financial innovations and thus a more detailed understanding of the complexity of the financial innovation process is a crucial element in the new market context. Shiller (2009 FT) argued that bad complexity should be distinguished from good complexity in the financial innovation process. Nevertheless, as several authors point out (Anderloni and Bongini, 2009; Frame and White, 2004), studies on financial innovation are few and does not provide a consistent framework for understanding the financial innovation process. <br><br>
Mention and Torkkeli (2012) recently suggested the need for a more holistic approach to think of financial innovation. By addressing the questions of what, why and how, they open what they call the financial innovation black box that highlights unique characteristics of financial innovation and shed light on how innovation occurs in financial services. This paper goes a step further to open the black box of financial innovations by pointing out that there is need for a more detailed theory; one that addresses the increasing complexity of the financial innovation process derived from factors such as the development of technology, institutions, the startup revolution and historical and economic variables. The importance of such a detailed theory of financial innovations is also justified by the recent evolution of the management approach towards a ‘contextual approach’, where innovating companies adapt their innovation practices to their context and (Ortt and van der Duin, 2008). <br><br>
The hypothesis that this paper is conceptually discussing is whether it is possible to construct a unifying theory that explains the process of financial innovation in general and, if not, provide an alternative to a general theory. By general we mean a theory that is able to encompass the observed complexities and diversities in the financial innovation process. To answer this question we follow the research method proposed by Poole and Van de Ven (1989, 1995). Poole and Van de Ven(1989,1995)examined the variety of theories proposed to understand organizational change and innovation and the question that they tried to answer was how to make sense of the multiplicity of these theories. They further suggested that instead of trying to stipulate one theory as the best choice to explain innovation or to derive a single general theory of change, it would be more informative and useful to consider a set of theories and models that can be combined and applied to understand innovation and change. We believe that this research method is suitable for understanding financial innovations for two reasons: first, financial innovation is a multifaceted process, involving different actors and perspectives, and incorporating different and dynamic generative mechanisms. Second, several theories have been proposed for explaining financial innovation, however, confusion still exists as to when they apply, what their limitations are and how they relate to each other. <br><br>
This paper begins with a discussion of the meaning of financial innovation. Successively, we provide an overview of the existing classification schemes and propose our own classification. We then turn to exploring the differences between financial and other types of innovations, describing features that are unique to financial innovations. In the section that follows, we identify and examine the existing objects of study in the financial innovation literature; we group them under four main concepts and illustrate the degree of development of each. We argue that the existing approach, which relies on isolated objects of study of financial innovation, is likely to lack several of the theoretical connections and complexities that are essential to understand and manage financial innovations’ thus making it difficult for a general (detailed) theory of financial innovations to emerge. In the last section, we introduce the concept of meta-theory of financial innovation, by identifying and explaining four theories of development. We provide several examples of how this approach results in more detailed and complex theories that better explain the phenomena of financial innovation and close with a conclusion and some recommendations for future research. <br><br>

  <h3>Modeling Complex Geopolitical Conflicts : The Syria-Iraqi Conflict</h3>
      <img src="middleeast.jpg">
  <p style="font-size:1vw ;line-height: 0.1vw"><i>In collaboration with Suhaib Jamal and Reza Jafari</i><p>    
  <p>In the post-modern reality, geopolitical conflicts are characterized by a complex and non-deterministic behaviour, thus reducing our ability to understand them with the traditional rational approach (Hughes 2003, Gallo 2013, Dickson 2016). The Uppsala Conflict Data Program, which collects data on armed conflicts, shows that the defining characteristic of most of the post-cold war military conflicts is the growing number of internationalized armed conflicts, that is, conflicts in which one or more states contribute troops and resources to one or both warring sides (Pettersson & Wallensteen 2015). Furthermore, the term ‘proxy war’, in which governments (or sponsors) aid and abet non-state organizations involved in a conflict against a common enemy, or a target, has increasingly been a shaping aspect of the post-modern warfare (Mumford 2013). Among the most obvious examples of such multifaceted conflicts is the ongoing military war in Iraq and Syria. The Syria-Iraq military struggle is considered among the most internationalized and proxy-driven conflicts, given the unprecedented number of involved parties that mostly act mostly through proxies (Cunningham et.al 2016, Hughes 2014). Besides being an internationalized and proxy-driven conflict, the Syria-Iraq situation is a complex and dynamic one.<br><br>

To understand this conflict, traditional tools which assume linearity and simple cause-effect relations may result in inaccurate analysis which may produce flawed policy that creates the potential for unintended, and possibly quite unpleasant, consequences (Carpenter 2013, 2016). Some existing studies showed that the conflict in the Middle East is not an exception and could be explained using a general theory of civil wars (Sørli, Gleditsch,& Strand 2005). However, the civil war theory does not explain the proxy wars and global power rebalancing phenomena, which are a crucial element in the ongoing Middle East conflict. On the other hand, too many accounts of the Middle East conflict tend to conclude that the source of instability lies mainly in single groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), ignoring the fact that the complex nature of the situation, which led to the emergence of ISIS, is driven and shaped mainly by the interactions among the different parts in the conflict. There is no doubt that the Islamic State is a crucial part of the equation, however given their strategy of fighting whoever opposes them, the Islamic State has set itself as a common enemy of all the other parties to the Middle East conflict, no matter what their ideology or goals are. One possible implication of this situation is that the scenario of destroying ISIS will not put an end to the complex situation that has been evolving between the other conflicting sides in Syria and Iraq. <br><br>

In this research we do two things. First, by focusing on the ongoing military conflict in Iraq and Syria, we show that the conflict in the Middle East satisfies the conditions for a complex conflict. To analyse this complex conflict we borrow tools from the science of complexity, which has emerged as the generic framework for studying complex systems (Holland 2014). We start by considering a total of 18 parties, who have involved themselves in the ongoing Iraq-Syria military struggle, including states and non-state organizations. The analysed situation refers to the period between 2013 and 2015, which is the period that witnessed the highest levels of tension and complexity (Cockburn 2016). Beginning from the year 2016, there have been a series of changes and rethinking of the relations among the parties whose nature is still unclear yet. Since relations among the parties in a military conflict often reflect a mixture of positive (allies) and negative (foes) interactions, we construct an empirical signed network (Leskovec, Huttenlocher, and Kleinberg 2010) of the interactions between the 18 groups. Links between the nodes are of three types: +1 link if they the chosen pair are allies, -1 if they are foes and 0 (no link) if they have neutral relationship towards each other. After constructing the signed network, the method of hierarchical clustering is used to extract the hierarchy of the conflict (Han, Pei, and Kamber 2011). The result of hierarchical clustering is presented in the form of a dendrogram, which we treat as the map of the complexity of the conflict. In order to compare the complexity of the situation when we exclude the Islamic State from the conflict we conduct the same analysis and we get a new dendrogram. Results for both models (with and without ISIS) are discussed and compared. Our conclusion is that the effect of removing the Islamic State from the conflict on the complexity of the situation is very small.  <br><br>
To conduct further analysis on the effect of removing the Islamic State from the Syria-Iraq conflict, we analyze our signed network by applying the concept of Structural Balance Theory which was introduced by (Heider 1958). Fritz Heider originated Balance Theory to show how people develop their relationships with other people and with things in their environment. Using the concepts of balanced and unbalanced triangles to construct an aggregated measure of the ability of the system to change, we found that even after removing the Islamic State, the system has a frozen state that does not change because of the removal of the Islamic State. <br><br>
Our analysis shows that the resolution to the ongoing conflict in Syria and Iraq must take into consideration the multilayer nature of the conflict, where different layers reflect differences or similarities on the strategic and ideological level. <br><br>
