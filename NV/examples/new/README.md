This scatterplot is part of the extension of my blog on [Using a D3 Voronoi grid to improve a chart's interactive experience](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/07/voronoi.html). After writing that blog [Franck Lebeau came with another version](http://bl.ocks.org/Kcnarf/c6e9c98a55287e6cd03aae7080b9ec90) which uses large circles to define the tooltip region. I thought this was a great idea! But I made this variation on his code, because I felt that the extra code used in this example (versus [the previous version 4]((http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/801c4bb101e86d19a1d0))) is more in line with the rest of the code.

The tooltip now reacts when you hover over an invisible large circular region around each circle.

- [Step 1: Tooltip attached to circle element](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/d5ef6c58f85aba2da48b)
- [Step 2: Tooltip attached to voronoi cell](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/65f03d1ebd1742196200)
- [Step 3: Tooltip attached to circle](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/c0ffc07b23b1c556a66b)
- [Step 4: Extra hover effects and interactivity](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/801c4bb101e86d19a1d0)
- [Step 5: Update with distance limiting circles - made visible](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/1ff72d1ab2340710d851c50f6ead7415)
- Step 6: This is step 6 :)
